# Task 
Create a City Builder Simulation in C++, applying design patterns to make the system scalable, maintainable, and flexible. The project involves managing elements like buildings, utilities, transportation, citizens, and government, showcasing their ability to design complex software using object-oriented principles.

# Timeline
Your team will be expected to meet with your assigned tutor/AL weekly. This will ensure
that your team stays on track to meet the deadline. The initial design component of the
project also serves as practical 6.

1. 13 October - Team registration of 5 to 7 members to be completed. Assign a team
lead. Complete this registration on the CS portal
2. 15 October - Submit initial project design (Practical 6)
3. 15 and 16 October - Get initial design marked and receive feedback
4. 22 and 23 October - Demonstrated updated initial design (if necessary) and
skeleton implementation
5. 29 and 30 October - Review minimal viable project and receive feedback
6. 4 November - Submission of project on ClickUP.
7. 5 and 6 November - Project demos.
Please do not fall behind schedule. The project carries a significant weight in your final
